I am a quantitative freshwater fisheries ecologist interested in the intersection of theoretical and applied science. My research includes movement and survival of fish species of commercial or biological importance, the development of quantitative methods to estimate survival, informing decisions using established methods for the estimation of survival, life history evolution, habitat use, habitat restoration, development of Shiny-Apps among other topics.
