summary: I am currently developing a Spatially explicit model with collaborators from USGS and the QFC @ MSU. This project can have a very significant impact on how we measure mortality using acoustic telemetry.

Accurately estimating mortality rates can be challenging. Tagging studies have been working towards estimating natural and fishing mortality rates in multiple systems. All these tagging studies inherently yield spatial data, and mortality rates vary spatially because of differences in environmental conditions, animal movement and behavior, or where fishing activities are concentrated.

Modern passive tracking technology yields continuous data that has not been appropriately used to explicitely explore the spatial component of survival. 

This project aims to develop a new spatially-explicit model for acoustic telemetry data that can identify sources of mortality
